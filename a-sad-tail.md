House Stark of winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of winterfell, warden of the north, hand of the king, protector of the realm regent.

unfortunately, ned did meet the wrong end of an axe and lost his head

Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to being, and let me assure you he will DEFINITELY NOT DIE!
